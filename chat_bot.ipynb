    "In der Pflichtlektüre Russel & Norvig, Kapitel 26.3, werden verschiedene ethische Probleme diskutiert, die durch die Weiterentwicklung von künstlicher Intelligenz auftreten können. Seit einigen Jahren basiert fast alle neu entwickelte Software in der KI auf maschinellen Lernverfahren, die auf Big Data trainiert werden. Nennen Sie zwei weitere ethische Probleme, die dadurch entstehen könnten. Begründen Sie Ihre Antwort und nennen Sie mögliche Lösungen.\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Privacy\n",
    "The importance of privacy is all over the news lately ( Facebook case in USA for example). Having all this new machine learning techniques needs big data so you can train the algorithom on it. For me, I always have this question, if people know how much their data is exposed and used for \" maybe \" good purpose, will they agree?\n",
    "Personally, I have little experience with machine learning, I completely understand the need for the big data. I think the solution for this is being honest. Force whoever want to use your data to let you decide whether to agree or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "2-Will it change our behaviour?\n",
    "\n",
    "After I heard about the Turing Challenge in the lecture, I was amazed by it. The Chatbot Eugene Goostman succeeded for the first time, being able to fool more than half of the humans involved in what they thought was chatting with a person not a machine. This is only the start of an age where we will interact more frequently with machines as if they were humans. People have some limitations when it comes to attention and kindness, AI technologies have unlimited resources to build relationships and never get tired. This can be used for bad things. For example, if developed properly, can fool people with fake news or dangerous stuff. The solution for this in my opinion is to control the big projects of AI and try to avoid publishing the stuff that can be used badly. \n",
